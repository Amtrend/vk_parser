Work with vk comments
===============
Implementation of working with comments in VK:

Allows you to parse comments mentioning various words in real time.

* To function, you need to create an application in VK and upload a key to listen to comments through the VK administration.

* In a separate file, in the form of a list of dictionaries, indicate the set and parameter of words to search. They change periodically in VK; you need to track changes in the VK Api Streaming documentation
